JPA Entities:
To store GPS content we need define below entities:
- GPSMetadata: store GPS metadata content. It includes attributes : name, desc, author, time and link
- Waypoint: store Waypoint content. It includes attributes: lat, lon, name and sym
- Trackpoint: store Trackpoint content. It includes attributes: lat, lon, ele and time.
- GPSTrack: contains list of trackpoints.
- GPS: contains group of GPSMetadata, list of waypoints and GPSTrack.

JPA Entities:
- GPSMetadataRepository: to get metadata of GPS
- GPSRepository: to get and insert detail GPS data

Service:
- GPSservice: convert .gpx file to GPS object then call repositories to insert/get GPS track data

API Controller:
There are three API to implement for three enpoint as requirements.

- POST: /upload
	+ parameter: "file" - a upload file .gpx with xml format
	+ Action: parse content of .gpx file to GPS entity and store in H2 database

- GET: /gps?pageNo=<>&pageSize=<>
	+ parameter: pageNo, pageSize
	+ Action: return list lastest GPS track, order by metadata.time desc. it only includes metadata of GPS track (not detail data of GPS track)

- GET: /gps/{id}
	+ parameter: id of GPS track
	+ Action: return detail data of GPS track, includes: metadata, list of waypoints and GPSTrack value.

Work flow:
- API Controller --> GPSService --> Repositories --> Entities
